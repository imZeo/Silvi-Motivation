Dear Sir or Madam,
I am hereby applying for the two-year graduate programme Business Administration and E-Business at Copenhagen Business School, to take my education to the next level.
I graduated from Matej Bel University in Slovakia in 2015 with a bachelor degree in European Cultural Studies. I also have an AP Degree in Marketing Management from Copenhagen Business Academy, received 2018 January. I began this new programme because of my desire to redirect my focus from societal to business studies and combine the two fields to strengthen my future career.
My bachelor degree in European Cultural Studies provided me with valuable insights within the research methods applied in social science and the cultural studies executed through foreign languages shaped my understanding of intercultural communication. Throughout my Marketing Management studies I have gained a solid base for further business studies, both in a theoretical and a practical scope. During the last two years I have studied the main theories in marketing, organisation and economics, which I put to use during a full-time internship at the Danish company Copenhagen Cutlery A/S.
Additionally, I have been developing my skills within digital marketing and teamwork outside of the school as well, as a volunteer in the communication section of the student organisation Cphbusiness Students. I have been a part of the team that plans and executes their communication. Besides this I participated in two smaller projects carried out by the student consultancy initiative called Copenhagen Business Consultancy, where I have further improved my ability to work within a team and provided me with further insights into the business environment in Copenhagen.
I would like to pursue a career within digital communication, ideally as a part of a team that offers complex digital solutions to commercial businesses. The programme is especially appealing to me because it would enable me to build the knowledge on the foundation I have already received in the business area, but at the same time offers a set of skills that, albeit new to me, are essential to pursue a career within digital communication solutions, in the subjects and projects within the technology discipline.
I believe I could contribute to the programme with my blended educational background and with my experience within the digital marketing. My lifelong enrolment in an education combined with working and travelling experience abroad equipped me with a profile, that will be beneficiary for an international team of any kind. It is mainly the last two years spent in Denmark, that has enabled me to reach a level of maturity in both, my personal and professional life, in which a structured learning has become a personal desire rather than a duty. I would like to pursue this desire through enrolment in the Business Administration and E-business course at a prestigious business school - Copenhagen Business School.

Signed,
Silvia Triscova
